# Session Report â€” aws-automated-data-pipeline-iac

## Pipeline Goals

This AWS automated data pipeline is designed to ingest, process, and analyze data using a serverless, event-driven architecture. The main goals are:

- **Automate data ingestion**: Seamlessly upload raw data (e.g., JSON files) to an S3 bucket, triggering downstream processing.
- **Serverless processing**: Use AWS Lambda functions to process and transform data as it arrives, without managing servers.
- **Layered architecture**: Package and share common dependencies (e.g., database drivers) via Lambda Layers for efficiency and maintainability.
- **Event-driven analytics**: Trigger analytics workflows automatically when new processed data is available.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Use Terraform to provision, update, and manage all AWS resources in a repeatable, version-controlled way.
- **Cost efficiency and scalability**: Leverage AWS managed services (S3, Lambda, IAM) to scale on demand and minimize operational overhead.

## Step-by-Step Architecture & Workflow

### 1. S3 Buckets
- **Raw Data Bucket**: Receives incoming data files (e.g., `my-pipeline-raw-data-<suffix>`). Uploading a file here triggers the ingestion Lambda.
- **Processed Data Bucket**: Stores data after transformation/processing (e.g., `my-pipeline-processed-data-<suffix>`).
- **Analytics Data Bucket**: Stores results of analytics workflows (e.g., `my-pipeline-analytics-data-<suffix>`).

### 2. Lambda Layer
- **db_layer**: A Lambda Layer containing shared Python dependencies (e.g., `psycopg2-binary`, `boto3`, `sqlalchemy`). This is uploaded to S3 and attached to all Lambda functions that need these libraries.

### 3. Lambda Functions
- **Ingestion Lambda**: Triggered by new objects in the Raw Data Bucket. Reads the raw file, performs initial validation/transformation, and writes output to the Processed Data Bucket.
- **Processing Lambda**: Triggered by new objects in the Processed Data Bucket. Performs further processing, enrichment, or aggregation, and writes results to the Analytics Data Bucket.
- **Analytics Lambda**: Triggered by new objects in the Analytics Data Bucket. Runs analytics, reporting, or downstream notifications as needed.

### 4. Event Triggers & Permissions
- **S3 Event Notifications**: Each S3 bucket is configured to trigger the appropriate Lambda function on `s3:ObjectCreated:*` events, with optional prefix/suffix filters (e.g., only `.json` files).
- **IAM Roles & Policies**: Each Lambda function is provisioned with an IAM role granting only the permissions it needs (e.g., read/write to specific buckets, CloudWatch logging).

### 5. Packaging & Deployment
- **Artifacts**: Lambda function code and the shared layer are packaged as ZIP files in the `build/` directory.
- **Terraform Modules**: The infrastructure is modularized (separate modules for Lambda, Layer, etc.) for reusability and clarity.
- **Apply**: Running `terraform apply` provisions all resources, uploads artifacts, and wires up triggers and permissions.

### 6. Workflow Example
1. User or system uploads a raw data file (e.g., `data.json`) to the Raw Data Bucket.
2. S3 triggers the Ingestion Lambda, which processes the file and writes output to the Processed Data Bucket.
3. S3 triggers the Processing Lambda, which further processes the data and writes to the Analytics Data Bucket.
4. S3 triggers the Analytics Lambda, which performs analytics or reporting.
5. All logs and metrics are available in AWS CloudWatch for monitoring and troubleshooting.

### 7. Infrastructure as Code
- All resources, triggers, and permissions are defined in Terraform (`terraform/` directory). To deploy or update the pipeline, run:
```bash
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

### 8. Clean Up
- To remove all resources and avoid AWS charges, run:
```bash
cd terraform
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```

## Executive summary

This document records every action performed during the interactive session to make the repository runnable, install required tools, fix Terraform configuration errors, package Lambda artifacts, and attempt infrastructure provisioning with Terraform.

High-level results:
- Installed Terraform and build dependencies in the dev container.
- Fixed Terraform initialization errors caused by duplicate variable/output declarations and by unsafe attribute usage.
- Packaged the Lambda layer and function artifacts into `build/` so Terraform can package/deploy them.
- Ran a targeted Terraform apply to create S3 buckets and the Lambda layer; the layer and artifacts bucket were created, but two bucket creations failed due to pre-existing global S3 names (BucketAlreadyExists). This blocks a full apply until bucket names are made unique or existing buckets are imported.

The full chronological log, technical details, files modified, commands executed, and next steps are provided below. Use this file as a copy/paste-ready report or import it into Word by opening the Markdown file in a Markdown editor and saving as a .docx if desired.

## 1) Timeline of actions (chronological)

1. Restored earlier session context per the user's request.
2. Diagnosed that `terraform` was not present in the environment.
3. Installed system packages and Terraform (HashiCorp APT), plus Python/pip tooling needed for packaging Lambda layers.
4. Ran `terraform init`; encountered errors caused by duplicate variable/output declarations inside Terraform modules; edited modules to remove duplicates and re-ran `terraform init` successfully.
5. Encountered errors in `terraform apply` caused by unsafe `.count` usage, unsupported S3 notification blocks, and file path resolution for ZIP files. Iteratively fixed these issues:
   - Replaced `.count` references with `length()` in outputs where appropriate.
   - Refactored S3 notification configuration (removed unsupported dynamic `filter` block and used provider-compatible attributes).
   - Changed module `filename` inputs to use absolute paths via `abspath("${path.root}/../build/...")` so file functions like `filemd5` can access the ZIPs.
6. Packaged the Lambda layer (`build/layer.zip`) and created placeholder handler files for processing & analytics Lambdas (to allow packaging).
7. Created function ZIPs in `build/` for ingestion, processing, and analytics lambdas.
8. Ran a targeted Terraform apply (S3 buckets + layer). The artifacts bucket and layer were created, but two bucket creations failed with `BucketAlreadyExists` (HTTP 409) because the configured bucket names were not globally unique.
9. Produced session exports and this report in Markdown format at `REPORT.md`.

## 2) Environment & tools installed

These packages and tools were installed or validated in the dev container where I executed commands:

- Terraform: v1.13.4 (installed via HashiCorp APT repository)
- AWS CLI: aws-cli/2.31.23 (pre-existing; validated)
- Python: 3.12.1 (validated)
- pip: 25.1.1 (validated)
- System packages used for building Python native extensions & packaging: build-essential, gcc, g++, python3-dev, libpq-dev, zip, unzip, curl, jq

Authentication and credentials:
- AWS credentials in the environment were used to run Terraform and AWS API calls; STS returned an identity (ARN) confirming credentials were valid in the session.

Notes:
- The exact apt install commands were run inside the container. If you want a recorded shell log of the installs I can paste it separately.

---

## 3) Repository edits and packaging

Key packaging and repo edits made so Terraform can find and upload the artifacts:

- Packaged Lambda layer from `src/ingestion_lambda/requirements.txt` into `build/layer.zip` (this includes Python dependencies required by the ingestion lambda including psycopg2-binary, boto3, sqlalchemy, etc.).
- Created minimal placeholder handlers to allow packaging of other lambdas:
  - `src/processing_lambda/handler.py` (placeholder)
  - `src/analytics_lambda/handler.py` (placeholder)
- Created function zip artifacts (manually since some packaging scripts failed due to environment shell hooks):
  - `build/ingestion_function.zip`
  - `build/processing_function.zip`
  - `build/analytics_function.zip`

- Changed Terraform module `filename` arguments to absolute paths so Terraform can evaluate file-based functions reliably from the `terraform` working directory:
  - e.g. `filename = abspath("${path.root}/../build/layer.zip")`

These packaging steps allowed `terraform` to reference the local artifacts reliably when creating `aws_s3_bucket_object` resources and `aws_lambda_layer_version`.

---

## 4) Terraform debugging & fixes

Problems encountered and how they were resolved (or worked around):

- Duplicate output/variable declarations
  - Cause: module files contained duplicate variable/output definitions (declared both inline and in module `outputs.tf`/`variables.tf`).
  - Fix: removed duplicate declarations so `terraform init` can proceed.

- Use of resource `.count` attributes in expressions
  - Cause: code referenced attributes like `aws_lambda_layer_version.this.count` which are not valid expressions; later Terraform versions expose `count` metadata differently and using `.count` on resources is unsafe.
  - Fix: replaced with `length()` where appropriate (for example `length(aws_lambda_layer_version.this)`). This fixed errors about "Missing resource instance key" and invalid `.count` usage.

- `count` dependent on resource attributes (blocking apply)
  - Cause: `aws_lambda_permission` used `count = var.source_bucket == "" ? 0 : 1` where `var.source_bucket` was being passed a resource attribute (like `aws_s3_bucket.raw_data.id`). Terraform rejects `count` expressions dependent on resource attributes not known until apply.
  - Workaround: used a two-step (targeted) apply to first create the S3 buckets and layer so dependent resources can reference them in a subsequent apply. Long term fixes: make bucket names deterministic at plan time (append random suffix), refactor so `count` isn't dependent on resource attributes, or import existing buckets.

- Unsupported `filter` block inside `aws_s3_bucket_notification`
  - Cause: provider's `aws_s3_bucket_notification` expects `lambda_function` nested blocks with `filter_prefix`/`filter_suffix`, not the dynamic `filter` implementation used.
  - Fix: rewrote notification blocks to conform to provider expectations (or removed dynamic filter structure and used explicit prefix/suffix fields).

- `filemd5`/`filebase64sha256` failing due to relative paths
  - Cause: Terraform executed from `terraform/` directory so file(...) calls couldn't resolve relative paths to `build/`.
  - Fix: used `abspath("${path.root}/../build/...")` when passing filenames to modules so absolute paths are available.

- S3 bucket name collisions (BucketAlreadyExists)
  - Cause: static bucket names like `my-pipeline-raw-data` already exist globally.
  - Resolution options: append a `random_id` suffix (recommended), import existing buckets with `terraform import`, or rework module variables to accept user-supplied names.

## 5) Representative commands executed

(Commands were run from `/workspaces/aws-automated-data-pipeline-iac` and `/workspaces/aws-automated-data-pipeline-iac/terraform`.)

System checks:
```bash
which terraform
python3 --version
pip3 --version
aws --version
```

Installed terraform and tools (performed in the container):
```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install -y curl unzip zip build-essential gcc g++ python3-dev libpq-dev jq
# add hashicorp apt repo and install terraform
```

Terraform init after fixes:
```bash
terraform -chdir=terraform init
```

Packaging layer:
```bash
scripts/package_layer.sh src/ingestion_lambda/requirements.txt
# produced build/layer.zip
```

Targeted apply to create buckets + layer:
```bash
terraform -chdir=terraform apply -auto-approve \
  -target=aws_s3_bucket.raw_data \
  -target=aws_s3_bucket.processed_data \
  -target=aws_s3_bucket.analytics_data \
  -target=module.db_layer.aws_s3_bucket.artifacts \
  -target=module.db_layer.aws_s3_bucket_object.layer \
  -target=module.db_layer.aws_lambda_layer_version.this
```

Result: The artifacts bucket and lambda layer were created, but bucket creation for `raw_data` and `processed_data` failed with `BucketAlreadyExists` (HTTP 409).

## 6) Files added or modified

Files added:
- `REPORT.md` (this report)
- `src/processing_lambda/handler.py` (placeholder)
- `src/analytics_lambda/handler.py` (placeholder)
- `build/layer.zip`, `build/ingestion_function.zip`, `build/processing_function.zip`, `build/analytics_function.zip` (artifacts created during session)

Files modified (examples):
- `terraform/main.tf` â€” updated module `filename` values to `abspath(...)`, planned changes to bucket naming (random suffix option), removed duplicate declarations.
- `terraform/modules/lambda/main.tf` â€” removed duplicate outputs, adjusted outputs to use `length()`, refactored notification and permission logic.
- `terraform/modules/layer/main.tf` â€” removed duplicate variable/output declarations, used `abspath(...)` for S3 object upload source, and replaced `.count` usage with `length()` where applicable.

Note: For exact diffs, review git history or run `git status` and `git diff` in the repo â€” I can provide the exact patches if you want them saved as a commit.

---

## 7) Current state and blocking issues

- `terraform init` now succeeds and providers are installed (aws v6.18.0, random v3.7.2).
- The layer artifact and artifacts S3 bucket were created by the targeted apply.
- Two S3 buckets failed to create due to global name collisions (BucketAlreadyExists). This prevents a full `terraform apply` that would create the Lambda function resources and S3 notifications.
- There is still Terraform logic that relies on resource attributes for `count`; a long-term fix is to avoid `count` expressions that require unknown attributes at plan time or to make bucket names deterministic so the condition can be evaluated at plan time.

---

## 8) Recommended next steps (pick one)

Option A (recommended): Make bucket names unique and re-run full apply
- Edit `terraform/main.tf` to append an existing `random_id` value or add a new `random_id` to the bucket names so they become globally unique (e.g., `my-pipeline-raw-data-${random_id.bucket_suffix.hex}`) and then run:
```bash
terraform -chdir=terraform plan
terraform -chdir=terraform apply -auto-approve
```
This is the fastest way to avoid global name collisions.

Option B: Import existing buckets into Terraform state
- If the static bucket names already belong to you and you want Terraform to manage them, import them:
```bash
terraform -chdir=terraform import aws_s3_bucket.raw_data my-pipeline-raw-data
```
Then run a normal `terraform apply` to create remaining resources.

Option C: Make bucket names user-configurable variables
- Update `variables.tf` to expose `raw_bucket_name` and `processed_bucket_name` and require the operator to supply unique names at plan/apply time. This avoids surprises.

Option D: I prepare a patch and wait for your review
- If you want to review changes before applying, I can prepare the Terraform patch (name-suffix changes and any permission/notification changes) and show it here.

---

## 9) Appendix: sample logs and outputs (selected)

- Terraform init success (after fixes): providers installed: aws v6.18.0, random v3.7.2.
- Targeted apply result highlights:
  - Created: `module.db_layer.aws_s3_bucket.artifacts`, `module.db_layer.aws_s3_bucket_object.layer`, `module.db_layer.aws_lambda_layer_version.this`.
  - Failed to create: `aws_s3_bucket.raw_data`, `aws_s3_bucket.processed_data` with `BucketAlreadyExists` (HTTP 409).

If you want the raw terminal output for any of these runs I can paste it into a separate file or attach it here.

---

## Closing summary

I created this `REPORT.md` in the repository root so you can open it, edit it, or export it to Word. Tell me which option from the "Recommended next steps" you want me to take (A/B/C/D). If you choose A, I'll implement the name-suffix patch and run a full `terraform apply` and then report the results. If you prefer a .docx file instead of Markdown I can convert the Markdown to a .docx and save it in the repo (requires adding a small Python conversion step â€” say the word and Iâ€™ll create it).

*End of report*

## Update â€” Terraform apply (2025-10-28)

I ran `terraform init`, `terraform plan` and a full `terraform apply -auto-approve` from the `terraform` directory during this session. The apply completed successfully and the repository's Terraform configuration was deployed into the configured AWS account.

Key results from the apply:

- Apply outcome: completed successfully
- Resources: 19 added, 1 changed, 1 destroyed
- Outputs (bucket names created):
  - raw_bucket = "my-pipeline-raw-data-bdbdeadb"
  - raw_bucket_arn = "arn:aws:s3:::my-pipeline-raw-data-bdbdeadb"
  - processed_bucket = "my-pipeline-processed-data-bdbdeadb"
  - processed_bucket_arn = "arn:aws:s3:::my-pipeline-processed-data-bdbdeadb"
  - analytics_bucket = "my-pipeline-analytics-data-bdbdeadb"
  - analytics_bucket_arn = "arn:aws:s3:::my-pipeline-analytics-data-bdbdeadb"

Notes and observations:

- I added a `random_id` suffix to the bucket names to ensure global uniqueness. That resolved the earlier `BucketAlreadyExists` error.
- Terraform displayed several deprecation warnings (use of `acl` on `aws_s3_bucket`, `aws_s3_bucket_object` vs `aws_s3_object`, deprecated `key` attribute). These are non-blocking but should be addressed in a follow-up cleanup.
- The Lambda layer artifact was uploaded to the artifacts bucket and a `aws_lambda_layer_version` was created; Lambda functions, IAM roles/policies, permissions, and S3 notifications were also created as part of the apply.

I'll update this `REPORT.md` each time I run Terraform so it always reflects the latest deployed state. If you want, I can also:

- Commit these Terraform changes to git and open a PR with the edits.
- Convert this report to a `.docx` file and save it in the repo.
- Tear down the infrastructure (`terraform destroy`) to avoid charges.

Tell me which follow-up you want and I'll update the report again after completing it.
