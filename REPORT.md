## Session Report — Automated Data Pipeline (trimmed)

This document records the actionable changes made during the session, the architecture and workflow of the pipeline as configured in this repository, verification steps that were performed, and next steps to finalize the deployment.

Date: 2025-10-30

## Goals
- Provision an S3-based automated data pipeline using Terraform.
- Provide Lambdas for ingestion -> processing -> analytics with a shared Lambda Layer for DB drivers.
- Wire S3 events reliably so multiple Lambdas can receive the same events (avoid notification clobbering).
- Use a public dataset (Chinook SQLite DB) to drive the pipeline and validate end-to-end behavior.
- Document everything and provide the commands to reproduce and finish deployment.

## High-level changes applied

- Installed and used Terraform in the dev container to manage AWS resources (init/plan/apply cycles were executed during the session).
- Cleaned and fixed Terraform modules so `terraform init` and subsequent plans succeed.
- Ensured S3 bucket names are unique by appending a `random_id` suffix in `terraform/main.tf`.
- Reworked the Lambda module to stop creating per-module `aws_s3_bucket_notification` resources (these overwrite a bucket's notification configuration when multiple modules are used).
- Introduced EventBridge (CloudWatch Events) rules and targets in the root `terraform/main.tf` to route S3 ObjectCreated events (for `raw/` and `processed/` prefixes) to the processing and analytics Lambdas respectively.
- Made lambda permission configurable via module inputs (`invoke_principal`, `invoke_source_arn`) to support EventBridge-based invocations.
- Patched `src/ingestion_lambda/handler.py` to fix a local-variable assignment bug and to support downloading a SQLite DB from S3 (support for DB_S3_BUCKET/DB_S3_KEY). This fixed the UnboundLocalError and enabled the ingestion Lambda to read `db/chinook.db` uploaded to S3.
- Packaged updated Lambda zip(s) under `build/` and used Terraform to update the function code and permissions where possible.
- Downloaded a public Chinook SQLite DB from GitHub and uploaded it to the raw bucket at `db/chinook.db` to drive ingestion tests.

## Files changed (summary)
- terraform/main.tf — Added EventBridge rules/targets and passed `invoke_principal`/`invoke_source_arn` into the lambda modules. Added `random_id`-based suffix for buckets (already present during earlier steps).
- terraform/modules/lambda/main.tf — Removed per-module `aws_s3_bucket_notification` and made `aws_lambda_permission` configurable (variable-driven principal/source_arn).
- terraform/modules/lambda/variables.tf — Added variables `invoke_principal` and `invoke_source_arn`.
- src/ingestion_lambda/handler.py — Fixed DB path handling (use `db_path` local variable to avoid UnboundLocalError), added support for DB download from S3 and fallback to DB_S3_BUCKET/DB_S3_KEY.
- build/ingestion_function.zip — Rebuilt (packaged updated handler). (Binary artifact)

Full edits (for reference)
- See the commits and terraform plan output in the Terraform run logs for exact diffs. The most important logical changes were:
  - per-module S3 notifications removed
  - EventBridge rules/targets added at root
  - lambda permission now uses `events.amazonaws.com` where EventBridge targets call the lambda

## Architecture (concise)

The pipeline is organized into three logical stages backed by S3 buckets:

- raw bucket: receives raw payloads produced by the ingestion Lambda (and also stores the Chinook DB as `db/chinook.db`).
- processed bucket: stores transformed payloads produced by the processing Lambda.
- analytics bucket: stores aggregated analytics/summary JSON produced by the analytics Lambda.

Processing logic (Lambda code summary):
- Ingestion Lambda (`src/ingestion_lambda/handler.py`)
  - DB_TYPE=sqlite (configured via Terraform environment)
  - Downloads the SQLite DB from `s3://<raw_bucket>/db/chinook.db` to `/tmp` and runs a query (configurable via `INGEST_QUERY`) to retrieve rows.
  - Uploads a JSON payload to `s3://<raw_bucket>/raw/<timestamp>/<uuid>.json` containing `fetched_at`, `row_count`, and `rows`.

- Processing Lambda (`src/processing_lambda/handler.py`)
  - Triggered by S3 events for new objects under `raw/` (via EventBridge in the new setup).
  - Loads the raw payload, selects/renames fields (track_id, track_name, album_title, composer, milliseconds, unit_price), writes a processed JSON under `processed/` and writes an analytics summary (`analytics/..._summary.json`) to the analytics bucket.

- Analytics Lambda (`src/analytics_lambda/handler.py`)
  - Placeholder minimal function; in this session it was prepared to receive `processed/` object-created events via EventBridge and could run further aggregation/workflows.

Notes:
- S3 -> Lambda fan-out: originally attempted with S3 bucket notifications per-module, which overwrote the bucket notification when multiple modules each defined a `aws_s3_bucket_notification`. To fix this, I switched to EventBridge rules and targets created at the root Terraform module and changed the module permission to allow `events.amazonaws.com` to invoke the target Lambda.

## Workflow (sequence)
1. A DB is available in `s3://<raw_bucket>/db/chinook.db` (we uploaded a public Chinook DB to this path).
2. The ingestion Lambda is invoked (manual or scheduled). It downloads the DB, runs `INGEST_QUERY` and writes a JSON file to `s3://<raw_bucket>/raw/<timestamp>/<uuid>.json`.
3. S3 emits an ObjectCreated event which EventBridge matches with `raw_to_processing` rule.
4. EventBridge target transforms the event into a small S3-style `Records` object and invokes the processing Lambda.
5. Processing Lambda reads the raw payload, transforms rows, writes processed JSON to `s3://<processed_bucket>/processed/...` and writes an analytics summary to `s3://<analytics_bucket>/analytics/...`.
6. EventBridge similarly routes `processed/` object-created events to the analytics Lambda (if the analytics Lambda performs additional aggregations or notifications).

## Verification performed here

- I downloaded the Chinook SQLite DB from GitHub and uploaded it to: `s3://my-pipeline-raw-data-bdbdeadb/db/chinook.db`.
- I patched and packaged the ingestion Lambda and applied Terraform changes to update the function code where AWS credentials allowed the operation.
- I invoked the ingestion Lambda from the CLI; the function returned:

```
{ "status": "ok", "s3_path": "s3://my-pipeline-raw-data-bdbdeadb/raw/2025-10-28T17-32-55Z/<uuid>.json", "row_count": 500 }
```

- After ingestion produced a raw JSON, EventBridge rules were created in Terraform. However, a final `terraform apply` to fully provision EventBridge resources and permissions failed in this environment because the AWS credentials used here became invalid/expired (STS GetCallerIdentity returned InvalidClientTokenId). This prevented the final apply and live verification of EventBridge->Lambda fan-out in your AWS account from this session.

Locally reproducible checks (worked during session)
- Local `src/ingestion_lambda/local_run.py` tests reading `data/chinook.db` returned a successful local ingest (wrote JSON to `build/local_uploads/`).
- Lambda invocation (CLI) confirmed ingestion produced raw JSON objects in the raw bucket.

## How to finish deployment (actions you can run now)

1) Ensure the environment has valid AWS credentials accessible to Terraform (environment variables, `aws configure`, SSO login, or otherwise). Verify:

```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

2) From the repo root, create the function zip(s) (already done in session but re-run if you changed code):

```bash
cd /workspaces/aws-automated-data-pipeline-iac
# package ingestion (and other lambdas if changed)
zip -j build/ingestion_function.zip src/ingestion_lambda/handler.py
zip -j build/processing_function.zip src/processing_lambda/handler.py
zip -j build/analytics_function.zip src/analytics_lambda/handler.py
```

3) Apply Terraform to create EventBridge rules & permissions (this step requires valid AWS credentials):

```bash
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform plan -out=tfplan -input=false
terraform apply -input=false -auto-approve tfplan
```

4) Trigger ingestion (manual test):

```bash
# invoke ingestion Lambda
aws lambda invoke --function-name <ingestion-function-name> --payload '{}' /tmp/ingest_out.json --cli-binary-format raw-in-base64-out
cat /tmp/ingest_out.json

# or upload a copy of an existing raw object to create an ObjectCreated event
aws s3 cp s3://<raw_bucket>/raw/<existing-file> s3://<raw_bucket>/raw/test-trigger-$(date +%s).json
```

5) Verify processing and analytics outputs

```bash
aws s3 ls s3://<processed_bucket> --recursive
aws s3 ls s3://<analytics_bucket> --recursive
```

6) If EventBridge is active and the lambdas have the `events.amazonaws.com` permission and target was created, the processing lambda will be invoked automatically and analytics JSON should appear.

## Sample transformation (what ends up in analytics)

- From Chinook Track rows the processing Lambda selects:
  - track_id, track_name, album_title, composer, milliseconds, unit_price
- The analytics artifact is a small JSON summary mapping album_title -> count (album_counts) and a pointer to the processed object.

Example `analytics/..._summary.json` (representative):

```json
{
  "generated_from": "s3://my-pipeline-raw-data-bdbdeadb/raw/2025-10-28T17-32-55Z/<uuid>.json",
  "album_counts": { "For Those About To Rock (We Salute You)": 5, "Back In Black": 7 }
}
```

## Troubleshooting / notes
- If new objects aren't invoking processing/analytics lambdas:
  - Confirm EventBridge rules exist (`aws events list-rules` / Terraform state)
  - Confirm `aws_cloudwatch_event_target` entries exist and targets show the Lambda ARN
  - Confirm Lambda permissions allow `events.amazonaws.com` to invoke the function (`aws lambda get-policy --function-name <name>`)
  - If S3 notifications were previously created for the same bucket with Terraform, they were removed in favor of EventBridge in this session to avoid overwrite conflicts.

- Deprecation warnings: some Terraform config used `acl` on `aws_s3_bucket` and `aws_s3_bucket_object` (older resource names). These are warnings and not blocking here; consider upgrading to `aws_s3_object` and `aws_s3_bucket_acl` in a follow-up.

## Next steps I can take for you
1. Re-run `terraform apply` and finish EventBridge provisioning after you refresh AWS credentials in this environment. Then I'll trigger ingestion and verify analytics objects appear in the analytics bucket (I can do this for you and report the output).
2. Add CI automation to package and deploy the Lambda zips and run a smoke test (would add a `Makefile` or GitHub Action).
3. Expand analytics lambda to run time-windowed aggregation and persist results to DynamoDB or Redshift (design + implementation is available if you want it).

## Short completion summary

What changed: Terraform modules were made EventBridge-friendly (removing per-module S3 notifications), EventBridge rules and targets were added, ingestion handler fixed to support DB S3 download, and a public Chinook DB was uploaded to the raw bucket to test ingestion.

What still needs your action: refresh valid AWS credentials in the dev environment so the final Terraform apply can complete and EventBridge can be validated end-to-end. Once that is done I will finish the apply and perform live verification.

---
If you'd like, I can now (A) wait for you to refresh credentials and then finish the apply & verification, (B) produce a downloadable `.docx` of this report, or (C) open a PR with the Terraform changes and notes. Tell me which next step you prefer.
# Session Report — aws-automated-data-pipeline-iac

## Pipeline Goals

This AWS automated data pipeline is designed to ingest, process, and analyze data using a serverless, event-driven architecture. The main goals are:

- **Automate data ingestion**: Seamlessly upload raw data (e.g., JSON files) to an S3 bucket, triggering downstream processing.
- **Serverless processing**: Use AWS Lambda functions to process and transform data as it arrives, without managing servers.
- **Layered architecture**: Package and share common dependencies (e.g., database drivers) via Lambda Layers for efficiency and maintainability.
- **Event-driven analytics**: Trigger analytics workflows automatically when new processed data is available.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Use Terraform to provision, update, and manage all AWS resources in a repeatable, version-controlled way.
- **Cost efficiency and scalability**: Leverage AWS managed services (S3, Lambda, IAM) to scale on demand and minimize operational overhead.

## Step-by-Step Architecture & Workflow

### 1. S3 Buckets
- **Raw Data Bucket**: Receives incoming data files (e.g., `my-pipeline-raw-data-<suffix>`). Uploading a file here triggers the ingestion Lambda.
- **Processed Data Bucket**: Stores data after transformation/processing (e.g., `my-pipeline-processed-data-<suffix>`).
- **Analytics Data Bucket**: Stores results of analytics workflows (e.g., `my-pipeline-analytics-data-<suffix>`).

### 2. Lambda Layer
- **db_layer**: A Lambda Layer containing shared Python dependencies (e.g., `psycopg2-binary`, `boto3`, `sqlalchemy`). This is uploaded to S3 and attached to all Lambda functions that need these libraries.

### 3. Lambda Functions
- **Ingestion Lambda**: Triggered by new objects in the Raw Data Bucket. Reads the raw file, performs initial validation/transformation, and writes output to the Processed Data Bucket.
- **Processing Lambda**: Triggered by new objects in the Processed Data Bucket. Performs further processing, enrichment, or aggregation, and writes results to the Analytics Data Bucket.
- **Analytics Lambda**: Triggered by new objects in the Analytics Data Bucket. Runs analytics, reporting, or downstream notifications as needed.

### 4. Event Triggers & Permissions
- **S3 Event Notifications**: Each S3 bucket is configured to trigger the appropriate Lambda function on `s3:ObjectCreated:*` events, with optional prefix/suffix filters (e.g., only `.json` files).
- **IAM Roles & Policies**: Each Lambda function is provisioned with an IAM role granting only the permissions it needs (e.g., read/write to specific buckets, CloudWatch logging).

### 5. Packaging & Deployment
- **Artifacts**: Lambda function code and the shared layer are packaged as ZIP files in the `build/` directory.
- **Terraform Modules**: The infrastructure is modularized (separate modules for Lambda, Layer, etc.) for reusability and clarity.
- **Apply**: Running `terraform apply` provisions all resources, uploads artifacts, and wires up triggers and permissions.

### 6. Workflow Example
1. User or system uploads a raw data file (e.g., `data.json`) to the Raw Data Bucket.
2. S3 triggers the Ingestion Lambda, which processes the file and writes output to the Processed Data Bucket.
3. S3 triggers the Processing Lambda, which further processes the data and writes to the Analytics Data Bucket.
4. S3 triggers the Analytics Lambda, which performs analytics or reporting.
5. All logs and metrics are available in AWS CloudWatch for monitoring and troubleshooting.

### 7. Infrastructure as Code
- All resources, triggers, and permissions are defined in Terraform (`terraform/` directory). To deploy or update the pipeline, run:
```bash
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

### 8. Clean Up
- To remove all resources and avoid AWS charges, run:
```bash
cd terraform
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```

## Executive summary

This document records every action performed during the interactive session to make the repository runnable, install required tools, fix Terraform configuration errors, package Lambda artifacts, and attempt infrastructure provisioning with Terraform.

High-level results:
- Installed Terraform and build dependencies in the dev container.
- Fixed Terraform initialization errors caused by duplicate variable/output declarations and by unsafe attribute usage.
- Packaged the Lambda layer and function artifacts into `build/` so Terraform can package/deploy them.
- Ran a targeted Terraform apply to create S3 buckets and the Lambda layer; the layer and artifacts bucket were created, but two bucket creations failed due to pre-existing global S3 names (BucketAlreadyExists). This blocks a full apply until bucket names are made unique or existing buckets are imported.

The full chronological log, technical details, files modified, commands executed, and next steps are provided below. Use this file as a copy/paste-ready report or import it into Word by opening the Markdown file in a Markdown editor and saving as a .docx if desired.

## 1) Timeline of actions (chronological)

1. Restored earlier session context per the user's request.
2. Diagnosed that `terraform` was not present in the environment.
3. Installed system packages and Terraform (HashiCorp APT), plus Python/pip tooling needed for packaging Lambda layers.
4. Ran `terraform init`; encountered errors caused by duplicate variable/output declarations inside Terraform modules; edited modules to remove duplicates and re-ran `terraform init` successfully.
5. Encountered errors in `terraform apply` caused by unsafe `.count` usage, unsupported S3 notification blocks, and file path resolution for ZIP files. Iteratively fixed these issues:
   - Replaced `.count` references with `length()` in outputs where appropriate.
   - Refactored S3 notification configuration (removed unsupported dynamic `filter` block and used provider-compatible attributes).
   - Changed module `filename` inputs to use absolute paths via `abspath("${path.root}/../build/...")` so file functions like `filemd5` can access the ZIPs.
6. Packaged the Lambda layer (`build/layer.zip`) and created placeholder handler files for processing & analytics Lambdas (to allow packaging).
7. Created function ZIPs in `build/` for ingestion, processing, and analytics lambdas.
8. Ran a targeted Terraform apply (S3 buckets + layer). The artifacts bucket and layer were created, but two bucket creations failed with `BucketAlreadyExists` (HTTP 409) because the configured bucket names were not globally unique.
9. Produced session exports and this report in Markdown format at `REPORT.md`.

## 2) Environment & tools installed

These packages and tools were installed or validated in the dev container where I executed commands:

- Terraform: v1.13.4 (installed via HashiCorp APT repository)
- AWS CLI: aws-cli/2.31.23 (pre-existing; validated)
- Python: 3.12.1 (validated)
- pip: 25.1.1 (validated)
- System packages used for building Python native extensions & packaging: build-essential, gcc, g++, python3-dev, libpq-dev, zip, unzip, curl, jq

Authentication and credentials:
- AWS credentials in the environment were used to run Terraform and AWS API calls; STS returned an identity (ARN) confirming credentials were valid in the session.

Notes:
- The exact apt install commands were run inside the container. If you want a recorded shell log of the installs I can paste it separately.

---

## 3) Repository edits and packaging

Key packaging and repo edits made so Terraform can find and upload the artifacts:

- Packaged Lambda layer from `src/ingestion_lambda/requirements.txt` into `build/layer.zip` (this includes Python dependencies required by the ingestion lambda including psycopg2-binary, boto3, sqlalchemy, etc.).
- Created minimal placeholder handlers to allow packaging of other lambdas:
  - `src/processing_lambda/handler.py` (placeholder)
  - `src/analytics_lambda/handler.py` (placeholder)
- Created function zip artifacts (manually since some packaging scripts failed due to environment shell hooks):
  - `build/ingestion_function.zip`
  - `build/processing_function.zip`
  - `build/analytics_function.zip`

- Changed Terraform module `filename` arguments to absolute paths so Terraform can evaluate file-based functions reliably from the `terraform` working directory:
  - e.g. `filename = abspath("${path.root}/../build/layer.zip")`

These packaging steps allowed `terraform` to reference the local artifacts reliably when creating `aws_s3_bucket_object` resources and `aws_lambda_layer_version`.

---

## 4) Terraform debugging & fixes

Problems encountered and how they were resolved (or worked around):

- Duplicate output/variable declarations
  - Cause: module files contained duplicate variable/output definitions (declared both inline and in module `outputs.tf`/`variables.tf`).
  - Fix: removed duplicate declarations so `terraform init` can proceed.

- Use of resource `.count` attributes in expressions
  - Cause: code referenced attributes like `aws_lambda_layer_version.this.count` which are not valid expressions; later Terraform versions expose `count` metadata differently and using `.count` on resources is unsafe.
  - Fix: replaced with `length()` where appropriate (for example `length(aws_lambda_layer_version.this)`). This fixed errors about "Missing resource instance key" and invalid `.count` usage.

- `count` dependent on resource attributes (blocking apply)
  - Cause: `aws_lambda_permission` used `count = var.source_bucket == "" ? 0 : 1` where `var.source_bucket` was being passed a resource attribute (like `aws_s3_bucket.raw_data.id`). Terraform rejects `count` expressions dependent on resource attributes not known until apply.
  - Workaround: used a two-step (targeted) apply to first create the S3 buckets and layer so dependent resources can reference them in a subsequent apply. Long term fixes: make bucket names deterministic at plan time (append random suffix), refactor so `count` isn't dependent on resource attributes, or import existing buckets.

- Unsupported `filter` block inside `aws_s3_bucket_notification`
  - Cause: provider's `aws_s3_bucket_notification` expects `lambda_function` nested blocks with `filter_prefix`/`filter_suffix`, not the dynamic `filter` implementation used.
  - Fix: rewrote notification blocks to conform to provider expectations (or removed dynamic filter structure and used explicit prefix/suffix fields).

- `filemd5`/`filebase64sha256` failing due to relative paths
  - Cause: Terraform executed from `terraform/` directory so file(...) calls couldn't resolve relative paths to `build/`.
  - Fix: used `abspath("${path.root}/../build/...")` when passing filenames to modules so absolute paths are available.

- S3 bucket name collisions (BucketAlreadyExists)
  - Cause: static bucket names like `my-pipeline-raw-data` already exist globally.
  - Resolution options: append a `random_id` suffix (recommended), import existing buckets with `terraform import`, or rework module variables to accept user-supplied names.

---

## 5) Representative commands executed

(Commands were run from `/workspaces/aws-automated-data-pipeline-iac` and `/workspaces/aws-automated-data-pipeline-iac/terraform`.)

System checks:
```bash
which terraform
python3 --version
pip3 --version
aws --version
```

Installed terraform and tools (performed in the container):
```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install -y curl unzip zip build-essential gcc g++ python3-dev libpq-dev jq
# add hashicorp apt repo and install terraform
```

Terraform init after fixes:
```bash
terraform -chdir=terraform init
```

Packaging layer:
```bash
scripts/package_layer.sh src/ingestion_lambda/requirements.txt
# produced build/layer.zip
```

Targeted apply to create buckets + layer:
```bash
terraform -chdir=terraform apply -auto-approve \
  -target=aws_s3_bucket.raw_data \
  -target=aws_s3_bucket.processed_data \
  -target=aws_s3_bucket.analytics_data \
  -target=module.db_layer.aws_s3_bucket.artifacts \
  -target=module.db_layer.aws_s3_bucket_object.layer \
  -target=module.db_layer.aws_lambda_layer_version.this
```

Result: The artifacts bucket and lambda layer were created, but bucket creation for `raw_data` and `processed_data` failed with `BucketAlreadyExists` (HTTP 409).

---

## 6) Files added or modified

Files added:
- `REPORT.md` (this report)
- `src/processing_lambda/handler.py` (placeholder)
- `src/analytics_lambda/handler.py` (placeholder)
- `build/layer.zip`, `build/ingestion_function.zip`, `build/processing_function.zip`, `build/analytics_function.zip` (artifacts created during session)

Files modified (examples):
- `terraform/main.tf` — updated module `filename` values to `abspath(...)`, planned changes to bucket naming (random suffix option), removed duplicate declarations.
- `terraform/modules/lambda/main.tf` — removed duplicate outputs, adjusted outputs to use `length()`, refactored notification and permission logic.
- `terraform/modules/layer/main.tf` — removed duplicate variable/output declarations, used `abspath(...)` for S3 object upload source, and replaced `.count` usage with `length()` where applicable.

Note: For exact diffs, review git history or run `git status` and `git diff` in the repo — I can provide the exact patches if you want them saved as a commit.

---

## 7) Current state and blocking issues

- `terraform init` now succeeds and providers are installed (aws v6.18.0, random v3.7.2).
- The layer artifact and artifacts S3 bucket were created by the targeted apply.
- Two S3 buckets failed to create due to global name collisions (BucketAlreadyExists). This prevents a full `terraform apply` that would create the Lambda function resources and S3 notifications.
- There is still Terraform logic that relies on resource attributes for `count`; a long-term fix is to avoid `count` expressions that require unknown attributes at plan time or to make bucket names deterministic so the condition can be evaluated at plan time.

---

## 8) Recommended next steps (pick one)

Option A (recommended): Make bucket names unique and re-run full apply
- Edit `terraform/main.tf` to append an existing `random_id` value or add a new `random_id` to the bucket names so they become globally unique (e.g., `my-pipeline-raw-data-${random_id.bucket_suffix.hex}`) and then run:
```bash
terraform -chdir=terraform plan
terraform -chdir=terraform apply -auto-approve
```
This is the fastest way to avoid global name collisions.

Option B: Import existing buckets into Terraform state
- If the static bucket names already belong to you and you want Terraform to manage them, import them:
```bash
terraform -chdir=terraform import aws_s3_bucket.raw_data my-pipeline-raw-data
```
Then run a normal `terraform apply` to create remaining resources.

Option C: Make bucket names user-configurable variables
- Update `variables.tf` to expose `raw_bucket_name` and `processed_bucket_name` and require the operator to supply unique names at plan/apply time. This avoids surprises.

Option D: I prepare a patch and wait for your review
- If you want to review changes before applying, I can prepare the Terraform patch (name-suffix changes and any permission/notification changes) and show it here.

---

## 9) Appendix: sample logs and outputs (selected)

- Terraform init success (after fixes): providers installed: aws v6.18.0, random v3.7.2.
- Targeted apply result highlights:
  - Created: `module.db_layer.aws_s3_bucket.artifacts`, `module.db_layer.aws_s3_bucket_object.layer`, `module.db_layer.aws_lambda_layer_version.this`.
  - Failed to create: `aws_s3_bucket.raw_data`, `aws_s3_bucket.processed_data` with `BucketAlreadyExists` (HTTP 409).

If you want the raw terminal output for any of these runs I can paste it into a separate file or attach it here.

---

## Closing summary

I created this `REPORT.md` in the repository root so you can open it, edit it, or export it to Word. Tell me which option from the "Recommended next steps" you want me to take (A/B/C/D). If you choose A, I'll implement the name-suffix patch and run a full `terraform apply` and then report the results. If you prefer a .docx file instead of Markdown I can convert the Markdown to a .docx and save it in the repo (requires adding a small Python conversion step — say the word and I’ll create it).

## Update — Terraform apply (2025-10-28)

I ran `terraform init`, `terraform plan` and a full `terraform apply -auto-approve` from the `terraform` directory during this session. The apply completed successfully and the repository's Terraform configuration was deployed into the configured AWS account.

Key results from the apply:

- Apply outcome: completed successfully
- Resources: 19 added, 1 changed, 1 destroyed
- Outputs (bucket names created):
  - raw_bucket = "my-pipeline-raw-data-bdbdeadb"
  - raw_bucket_arn = "arn:aws:s3:::my-pipeline-raw-data-bdbdeadb"
  - processed_bucket = "my-pipeline-processed-data-bdbdeadb"
  - processed_bucket_arn = "arn:aws:s3:::my-pipeline-processed-data-bdbdeadb"
  - analytics_bucket = "my-pipeline-analytics-data-bdbdeadb"
  - analytics_bucket_arn = "arn:aws:s3:::my-pipeline-analytics-data-bdbdeadb"

Notes and observations:

- I added a `random_id` suffix to the bucket names to ensure global uniqueness. That resolved the earlier `BucketAlreadyExists` error.
- Terraform displayed several deprecation warnings (use of `acl` on `aws_s3_bucket`, `aws_s3_bucket_object` vs `aws_s3_object`, deprecated `key` attribute). These are non-blocking but should be addressed in a follow-up cleanup.
- The Lambda layer artifact was uploaded to the artifacts bucket and a `aws_lambda_layer_version` was created; Lambda functions, IAM roles/policies, permissions, and S3 notifications were also created as part of the apply.

I'll update this `REPORT.md` each time I run Terraform so it always reflects the latest deployed state. If you want, I can also:

- Commit these Terraform changes to git and open a PR with the edits.
- Convert this report to a `.docx` file and save it in the repo.
- Tear down the infrastructure (`terraform destroy`) to avoid charges.

Tell me which follow-up you want and I'll update the report again after completing it.
